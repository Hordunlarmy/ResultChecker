    -   Generates a new scratch card.
    -   **Request Body:**
        ```json

            "amount": 100
        }
        ```

-   **GET `/admin/account-types`**

### 4. User Routes

These routes are protected and require authentication via Sanctum.

-   **GET `/user/check-result`**
    -   Allows a user to check their results.
    -   **Response:**
        -   User's result (if available)

**Authentication**

The API uses Sanctum for user authentication. Users must authenticate via login to access protected routes. Once logged in, the API will return an authentication token that must be included in the `Authorization` header as a `Bearer` token for any request to protected routes.
